> Trip planner right inside your pocket.

Preparing for a trip always costs a great amount of time, it is always inconvenient to search for
information of places of interests and form them into a single trip itinerary. To make this process
simpler, our application focus on centralizing all the information, such as ratings of a place of
interest, local traffic and weather. The application also provides a platform that you can post your
trip itineraries onto. If you want to create new trip plans, you can browse and fork the existing 
ones, editing them to make your own ones. You can simply add interest points to the itinerary and 
the application will generate the total time and suggested route for you.
